# DataStory

This project is front-end extension of a Python data analysis project analyzing mock pre-clinical trial data.  The analysis repo can be found [here](https://github.com/bman511/Pymaceuticals/blob/master/README.md).  This project uses HTML, CSS, and javascript to create a more interactive experience when exploring the results.  It heavily utilizes boostrap and bootswatch styling. 

The pages include discussion and visualization of:

- Tumor proliferation over time
- Average tumor size over time
- Mouse mortality throughout the trial
- Variability between cohorts in the trial
- A full table of trial data

Visualizations were produced with matplotlib and exported as png files.  The data cleaning/analysis was accomplished with Pandas and numpy.  An additional repo was created to provide a more interactive web-based experience using the visuals and discussion from this project.  View the final github-page collection [here](https://bman511.github.io/DataStory/).
